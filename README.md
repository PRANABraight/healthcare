## üéØ About The Project

Healthcare professionals are often faced with vast amounts of patient data from disparate sources. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a unified platform that simplifies complex data, identifies potential risks, and extracts meaningful information from unstructured text. It serves as a supplementary tool to support clinicians in providing safer and more personalized patient care.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üìä Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** An overview of key healthcare metrics, including patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and drug review statistics.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Clinical Text Analysis:** Utilizes NLP to perform word frequency analysis on medical transcriptions to identify key terms.
* **üíä Drug Interaction Checker:** A tool to check for known interactions between multiple drugs from a database of over 191,000 interactions.
* **ü©∫ Patient Risk Assessment:** A predictive model that calculates a patient's risk score based on demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, providing clinical recommendations.
* **üìà Advanced Analytics:** Deeper analysis into drug effectiveness, sentiment analysis of reviews, and clinical patterns across different patient cohorts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using the following technologies:

* [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/): For the core web application framework and UI.
* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): For all backend logic and data processing.
* [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
* [**Scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/): For machine learning models (e.g., Risk Assessment).
* [**NLTK / spaCy**](https://www.nltk.org/): For Natural Language Processing tasks.
* [**Plotly / Matplotlib**](https://plotly.com/): For creating data visualizations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

The application is powered by several distinct datasets, sourced from well-known clinical data repositories and web scraping:
* **MIMIC-IV and i2b2:** For clinical patient data.
* **DrugBank / RxNorm (Inferred):** For the drug interaction database.
* **Public Drug Review Datasets:** For patient reviews and sentiment analysis.

A key part of the data preparation process involved the removal of all Protected Health Information (PHI) to ensure patient privacy.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* `pip` package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_project_repository.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_project_repository.git)
    cd your_project_repository
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
The application should now be running and accessible in your web browser.
